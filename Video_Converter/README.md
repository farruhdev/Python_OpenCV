# Faro Coding Task

1. The program should have a GUI where it is possible for the user, to choose a video from a folder and import it, also choose the folder to export the processed video.

2. Your program should convert the video frames to grayscale.

3. You should do a Canny Edge Detection on each frame. Please note that this part should be implemented from yourself and not use a preimplemented function of a library (as in opencv for e.x.).

4. The computed frame should be put together to a stream and be saved as a video to the chosen folder.

5. (Optional) Please do a real time edge detection and play the original and processed video, side by side on your GUI.
